This is an auxiliary repo.  

Most importantly the `all_poi.csv` file is used in seeding [the main backend](https://github.com/copilotroadtrip/CoPilotBackend).  

In turn, the `.csv` is generated by `create_poi_csv.py`, which calls upon the `.shp` files in `POIData/`, the population info found in `subes2018_all.csv` and the class defined in `place_info.py`.  

The `search_tree.py` file is a deprecated attempt at increasing search speed via a search-tree.  

The `.ipynb` is used for demonstrations
